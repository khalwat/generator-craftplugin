# generator-craftplugin

generator-craftplugin is a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator for [Craft CMS](http://www.buildwithcraft.com) plugins

Type just `yo craftplugin` and a new Craft CMS plugin tailored to your liking will be created.

You can also access the generator via the web at [pluginfactory.io](http://pluginfactory.io)

## Installation

This assumes you have `nodejs`, `npm`, and `yeoman` installed already.

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `generator-craftplugin` directory onto your dev machine
2.  -OR- do a `git clone https://github.com/nystudio107/generator-craftplugin.git` directly onto your dev machine.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3. On the command line, from the root of the generator-craftplugin project (in the `generator-craftplugin/` folder), type: `npm link` to install the project dependencies and symlink a global module.  On some setups, you may have to do `sudo npm link --no-bin-links`
4.  -OR- do an `npm -g install generator-craftplugin` to install it via npm (and thus skip the `npm link` step)
5. The generator folder should be named `generator-craftplugin`.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

Requires Node version 4.0.0 or later.

## Usage

To create a new Craft CMS plugin and use generator-craftplugin to scaffold it:

    yo craftplugin

generator-craftplugin will ask you a few questions:

* **Plugin name:** - enter the name of your plugin
* **Short description of the plugin:** - enter a short (around 120 characters or less) description of the plugin and what it does
* **Plugin initial version:** - enter the initial version of the plugin, e.g.: `1.0.0` or `0.0.1`
* **Plugin author name:** - enter the name of the author of the plugin (either an individual or a company)
* **Plugin author URL:** - enter the URL (with the `http://`) of the website of the plugin author
* **Plugin author GitHub.com name:** - enter the GitHub.com handle of the author of the plugin.  If you don't have one, just leave it blank
* **Select what components your plugin will have:** - select the components you want included in your plugin, using the arrow keys to change the component, and `<space>` to select them.

If you selected `Controllers`, `ElementTypes`, `FieldTypes`, `Models`, `Purchasables`. `Records`, `Services`, `Tasks`, or `Widgets` components, it will also ask you for a name for each one, respectively.  If you want multiple components, just separate them with a , in the name input.

generator-craftplugin will then do the following for you:

1. Create the `pluginname` directory in the current directory, properly lower-cased and stripped of spaces
2. Create all of the properly named, documented files & folders for your new Craft CMS plugin

The code generated conforms to Pixel & Tonic's [Coding Standards](https://github.com/pixelandtonic/CodingStandards/blob/master/standards/PHP.md), and includes a number of other ancillary files such as `README.md`, `icon.svg`, `releases.json`, etc. to get you going.
